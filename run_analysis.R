## `readdataset` returns the resulting data frame from reading the files containing the measurement data
## and description
## Files:
## - 'X' file:       measurements
## - 'y' file:       activity corresponding to each measurement file row
## - 'subject' file: subject that was measured during the activity
##
## The returned data frame contains the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, represented
## by all the columns that have "-mean()" or "-std()" as its feature name.
##
## This function receives the following arguments
## - set:          being one of "train" or "test" as the data folder to be read
## - path:         the path where the set files are stored
## - features:     a dataframe containing the column number and description for each measurement
## - selcolumns:   an optional parameter (defaults to TRUE) to indicate if only
##                 the "mean" and "std" measurements should be included in the resulting
##                 dataframe
##
## The returned dataframe is composed by (in column order):
## - subject_id:   an integer identifying the subject
## - activity_id:  an integer identifying the activity
## - data columns: if selcolumns argument is set to TRUE (default), the mean and std columns, else
##                 all columns read are part of the dataframe

## `run_analysis` does the following:
##
## - Reads the "activities" and "features" files
## - Reads the "test" and "train" datafiles through the `readdataset` function
##       * `readdataset` uses the "features" file information - as a dataframe - to
##         (2) extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
##             measurement
##         (4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names through
##             the use of the "features" data frame, 'activity_id' as a link to the
##             activities file data and 'subject_id'
##         
## - (1) Merges the training and test sets to create one data set
##       * A new vector "set_id" is built with as many level ids of
##         test/train row numbers. (4) "set_id" is the descriptive column
##         name set identification
##       * Once the test and train dataframes are merged, the "set" vector
##         is column-binded to keep the set whose information belongs to
##
## - (3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##       * "activities" is considered as another set of data, so a merge() join
##         is done on 'activity_id'. The resulting dataframe includes the activity_id
##         and 'activity' column as the descriptive activity name
##
## - (5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
##       with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
